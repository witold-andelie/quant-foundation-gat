## Documents

| Document | Audience | Description |

| [gnn_capstone_design.md](gnn_capstone_design.md) | All | GNN relational-factor capstone architecture design (thesis, two-track graphs, milestones M1–M5); dual-track implementation banner up top |
| [CAPSTONE_STATUS.md](CAPSTONE_STATUS.md) | Agents / resume | Progress snapshot and resume point — module map (both tracks), test counts, environment quirks, prioritised next steps |
| [adr/](adr/) | All | Architecture decision records 0001–0006 (propagate seam, factor provider, training objective + split hygiene, equity-first→dual-track scope, equity correlation graph, energy interconnector graph) |
| [alpha_research.md](alpha_research.md) | Researchers | Alpha factor methodology, full 18-factor catalog (10 equity + 8 energy), four-gate validation framework (Robustness / Uniqueness / Value-added / Consistency), worked examples |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Engineers | System layers (ingestion → warehouse → factor engine → backtest → dashboard), production boundary, data flow diagram |
| [cloud_kubernetes.md](cloud_kubernetes.md) | DevOps | GCP deployment guide — Terraform IaC (Workload Identity, Secret Manager, BigQuery 3-layer), GKE cluster setup, Helm chart deployment, dev/prod overlays |
| [zoomcamp_coverage.md](zoomcamp_coverage.md) | Reviewers | Module-by-module DataTalksClub Zoomcamp coverage matrix — M1 through M7 + Workshops + Cloud, with concrete file references and test counts |
