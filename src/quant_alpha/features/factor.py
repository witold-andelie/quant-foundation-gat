"""Unified factor contract and the provider seam.

One `Factor` interface for both tracks (deepening #1) and a `FactorProvider`
seam so the apply step takes factors from any number of sources (deepening #2).
Island factors and relational (GNN) factors look identical at this layer — the
GNN factor is just a provider whose compute closes over a `Propagator`.

Panel contract: a factor's `compute` receives a panel indexed by a canonical
`(time, entity)` MultiIndex — `(date, symbol)` for equities, `(timestamp,
market)` for energy — carrying the raw and derived feature columns, and returns
a Series aligned to that index.
