"""The propagate seam.

One cross-section in, one factor value per node out. This is the deep module
that the GNN/GAT relational-factor capstone turns on: the existing
fully-connected cross-market mean and the new learned-attention GAT factor are
both *adapters* on this one interface, so the island-vs-relational A/B is a
single adapter swap.

Design decisions (see docs/adr/0001-propagate-seam.md):

- **Granularity** — operates on a single snapshot (one date/timestamp). The
  panel loop lives outside; this stays a pure transform.
- **Weighting** — the seam takes a *topology* (who connects to whom); each
  adapter decides how to weight it. Baseline = uniform; GAT = learned
  attention.
- **State** — transform-only. Learned weights are bound at construction
  (`GATPropagator.from_weights`); training lives outside this interface.
- **Hops / direction** — topology is directed (asymmetric transmission). Hop
  depth is an adapter construction parameter, not a seam parameter.
- **Output** — returns only the propagated per-node factor. Attention weights
  are a GAT-adapter-specific capability (`last_attention`), not on the seam.
